# Resource Architecture Kit (Working Title)

A composable, inspector-driven architecture framework for Godot.  
Designed for clean separation, modularity, and scalability â€” without sacrificing editor integration.

## Features
- Resource Variables (observer-based data)
- Game Events (editor-safe event bus)
- Logger abstraction
- Resettable runtime states

## Getting Started
1. Clone or add as a submodule
2. Activate in `Project > Plugins`
3. Start using resource variables!
